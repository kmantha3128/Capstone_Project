Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Indian restaurant in New York city.\n\nSince there are lots of restaurants in New york I will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. Also particularly interested in areas with no Indian restaurants in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met."
